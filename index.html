<h3>Heating/Cooling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>While there is a natural-gas furnace, there is no built-in AC. You can close vents both in the garage/basement and in the rooms to direct where you want the heat flowing.</li>
  <li>The sunroom is not insulated, so best to keep sliding doors shut at night to allow rest of house to stay warm/cool depending on the season.</li>
  <li>There is a portable AC unit that works well in either of the upstairs bedrooms, as well as an evaporation fan that works well and uses 30% of the electricity of an AC. Additionally, you may choose to run the furnace fan while the heat is OFF to circulate the cool air from the basement/under the house which helps keep the entire house cool on hot days.</li>
</ul>

  <!-- Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 90.222 allows a landlord to require you to have a renters insurance policy. Landlords are not allowed to require that they be named as an additional insured on the insurance policy. However, they can be named as having an interest in the policy so that they are informed if you let the policy lapse. ORS 90.222 does limit the amount of liability coverage the landlord can require. Refer to the statute if you believe the landlordâ€™s requirement is unreasonable. -->

<p>&mdash;<em>Prior to living in this house, affectionately named the Duchess on Duke,
  I owned a 3-level home near Mt Tabor for 16 years where I rented rooms. 
  (You can check me out on <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3677422">AirBnB</a>, 
  where I'm proud to share that I was a "super host" at the time I was hosting.)
  Many who visit The Duchess are quick to point out the "sanctuary" vibe, so don't miss this opportunity to make it yours.
