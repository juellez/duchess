<h3>Owner/Tennant</h3>
<p>I am on sabbatical from 25 years in tech/consulting. I'm currently enrolled in two programs learning somatic-based coaching and healing, and play
  music and acrobat when I can. 
  My partner runs a recording studio and works as an audio engineer contractor during the day. 
  While I often work from home, I'm also traveling a bit for my schooling.
  We're typically early to bed and early to rise—and use to a quieter household; though enjoy throwing the ocassional dinner party, yard party, and musical gathering.
  I said good-bye to my 20 year old pets last year, and would be happy to walk your dog on ocassion—though sadly can't allow cats due to allergies.  
</p>

<h3>The Home + Rooms</h3>
<p>Prior to living in this house, affectionately named the Duchess (due to her placement and a statue on the porch), 
  I owned a 3 story home near Mt Tabor for 16 years. There, I rented rooms for almost 15 years, so am well-versed in 
  tending to a house that's communal and private&mdash;and safe. 
  (You can check me out on <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3677422">AirBnB</a>, where I'm proud to share that I was a "super host" at the time I was hosting.)
  Many who visit The Duchess home are quick to point out the <em>"sanctuary"</em> vibe. This is a space where you can feel safe, 
  recharge, and get creative. 
<ul>
  <li>Back Room: &mdash; split-level upstairs and back: my bedroom that I share w/my partner.</li>
  <li>Front Room: &mdash; split-level upstairs, first room separated from the other bedroom by the bathroom (did I mention 2 sinks??). 
                        Currently setup as an office, I will be clearing it out in February for March availability. Lots of morning light with an East window and double North windows.</li>
  <li>Side Room: &mdsah; off the living-room, this is a small room. Luckily, closets line an entire wall, so no dresser needed&mdash;maximizing floor space.
                        Currently setup as a spare/guest room, available as soon as February 1.</li>
</ul>
